Subject: Quick idea to improve demo conversions
Email:
Hi Ali, noticed your product updates around reporting. Many PM SaaS teams see drop-offs after demos. We help founders fix that using a simple AI content + outreach workflow to pre-qualify leads and set expectations. If useful, happy to share a 2-step outline. Worth a quick 10-min chat?

Thanks, Ali! If relevant, I can share a short outline teams use to pre-qualify leads and reduce no-shows. Want me to send?
